# Firestore Tinker II

Details coming, but you can get a head start by playing with this code.

In short, this Tinker will be mostly focused on you expanding this application using the same principles that are being used to get the current functionality present.

You will be adding code that allows users to:

1) Join labs (rooms)
2) Have realtime chat with other people who are present in the room.

HackMD with more specifics will be completed tomorrow.
